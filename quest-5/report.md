## Summary
For this quest, we were tasked with creating a cruise control and collision avoidance system for an RC car. We achieve this using an ultrasonic sensor, a LIDAR sensor, an optical decoder, and PID control. Using these tools, we are able to stay within +/- 25cm of a centerline,

## Solution Design
### PID Speed Control and Ultrasonic Sensing

### LIDAR and Steering Control

### UDP Communication

### Wheel Speed Detection Using Optical Decoder

### Alphanumeric Display
We used a second I2C bus for the alphanumeric display, choosing two GPIO pins (27 and 33) to accomplish this.
