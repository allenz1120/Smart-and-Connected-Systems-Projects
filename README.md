# ReadMe
This is the repository for projects from my Smart and Connected Systems class from Fall 2020. I worked on these projects with my team members Alex Prior and John Kircher. Each project (aka quest) is separated into individual folders with respective readmes for each and video demonstration that can be found in the report.md. The order of projects goes from:

Quest 0 - Installs and Blink
Quest 1 - Fish Feeder
Quest 2 - Rasperry Pi and Sensors
Quest 3 - Hurricane Box with Remote Access DDNS
Quest 4 - IR Electronic Voting with Bully Algorithm
Quest 5 - Remote Cruise Control Car
Quest 6 - Remote Pet Camera with Sensors and Servos
