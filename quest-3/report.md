## Summary
The goal of this quest was to take thermistor and accelerometer data from the ESP32, send it to a web server created with node.js using UDP sockets, and display this data dynamically on a webpage. The webpage also displays a livestream using the webcam on the Raspberry Pi Zero, and a button for turning an LED on the ESP32â€™s breadboard on and off. The ESP32 and Raspberry Pi are connected wirelessly, with DDNS and port forwarding being utilized to access the webpage from anywhere in the world.
