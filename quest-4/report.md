## Summary
The purpose of this quest was to create a secure election process using both NFC and UDP communication between several voting FOBs and a central node.js server with a database for storing voter information and a web server for visualizing the data. One of the voting FOBs is selected to be the "poll leader" using a variation of the bully algorithm, with a new poll leader being elected in the case that the current poll leader fails.
